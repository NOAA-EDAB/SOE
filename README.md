## Overview

`ecodata` is an R data package developed by the Ecosystems Dynamics and
Assessment Branch of the Northeast Fisheries Science Center for use in
State of the Ecosystem (SOE) reporting. SOE reports are high-level
overviews of ecosystem indicator status and trends occurring on the
Northeast Continental Shelf. Unless otherwise stated, data are
representative of specific Ecological Production Units (EPUs), referring
to the Mid-Atlantic Bight (MAB), Georges Bank (GB), Gulf of Maine (GOM),
and Scotian Shelf (SS). SOE reports are developed for US Fishery
Management Councils (FMCs), and therefore indicator data for Scotian
Shelf are included when available, but this is not always the case.

### Please consult the [technical documentation](https://noaa-edab.github.io/tech-doc/) of SOE indicators before using data sets.

## Using this package

1.  Use the command
    `remotes::install_github("noaa-edab/ecodata",build_vignettes=TRUE)`
    to install the package.
2.  Load the package into your environment with `library(ecodata)`
3.  Further information about the `ecodata` package can be found
    [here](https://noaa-edab.github.io/ecodata/).

## Loading data sets

1.  All derived data sets are available once the package has been loaded
    into the environment. View available data sets using the syntax
    `ecodata::...`

## Using geom\_gls()

Also included in this package is a “geom” extension of `ggplot2` for
assessing trends in time series. This function fits four trend models to
each series, uses AICc to select the best model fit, and then implements
a likelihood-ratio test to determine if a trend is present. If a
significant trend is present (*P* &lt; 0.05), then the trend line is
plotted with the series. By default, a purple line color is assigned to
negative trends and orange to positive trends. More detailed information
about this method is available
[here](https://noaa-edab.github.io/tech-doc/trend-analysis.html).

`geom_gls()` follows the same rules as other `ggplot` stats/geoms. For
example,

    m <- 0.1
    x <- 1:30
    y <-  m*x + rnorm(30, sd = 0.35)

    data <- data.frame(x = x,
                      y = y)

    #Plot series with trend 
    ggplot2::ggplot(data = data,aes(x = x, y = y)) +
      geom_line() +
      geom_gls()

produces

## Build documentation

Organize
[Reference](https://noaa-edab.github.io/ecodata/reference/index.html) by
datasets and functions in `inst/_pkgdown.yml` and update using:

``` r
update_datasets_reference <- function(){
  library(here)
  library(dplyr)
  library(yaml)

  yml <- here("inst/_pkgdown.yml")

  lst <- read_yaml(yml)
  # listviewer::jsonedit(lst)
  
  # inject reference to datasets  
  datasets <- data(package="ecodata") %>% .$results %>% .[, "Item"]
  lst$reference <- list(
      title = "Datasets",
      contents = datasets)

  write_yaml(lst, yml)
}

# build just Reference index
pkgdown::build_reference_index()

# build whole documentation website into docs/*
pkgdown::build_site()
```

Note that when building, you’ll get alerted if datasets are missing or
not included, eg:

    > pkgdown::build_reference_index()
    Writing 'reference/index.html'
    Warning messages:
    1: In '_pkgdown.yml', topic must be a known topic name or alias
    x Not '`heatwave_year`' 
    2: In '_pkgdown.yml', topic must be a known topic name or alias
    x Not '`seasonal_sst_anom_gridded`' 
    3: In '_pkgdown.yml', topic must be a known topic name or alias
    x Not '`wind`' 
    4: Topics missing from index: 
    * ecodata
    * seasonal_sst_anomaly_gridded
    * soe 

Aside: get all plot chunks mentioning given dataset for Uploader:

``` r
dataset <- "chl_pp"
res <- system(glue::glue("grep ecodata::{dataset} chunk-scripts/*", intern = T))
# todo: get just filenames
res
```
